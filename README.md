# AoC24

Repo for the 2024 Advent of Code challenges

## Language

Python is my language of choice, even though I should have done it in Rust or Go... well I guess it's gonna happen next year

## Structure

Every solution contains a main function which invokes a first and second method, with each one printing the result of the problem

## TODO

Move the input and source files into separate folders to keep the root clean
